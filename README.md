This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file (main.ipynb) that follows the steps below:

1. Data Importing and Pre-processing
- Import dataset and describe characteristics such as dimensions, data types, file types, and import methods used
- Clean, wrangle, and handle missing data
- Transform data appropriately using techniques such as aggregation, normalization, and feature construction
- Reduce redundant data and perform need-based discretization

2. Data Analysis and Visualization
- Identify categorical, ordinal, and numerical variables within data
- Provide measures of centrality and distribution with visualizations
- Diagnose for correlations between variables and determine independent and dependent variables
- Perform exploratory analysis in combination with visualization techniques to discover patterns and features of interest

3. Data Analytics
- Determine the need for a supervised or unsupervised learning method and identify dependent and independent variables
- Train, test, and provide accuracy and evaluation metrics for model results

4. Presentation
- In a 5 to 10 minutes video, briefly explain the project workflow from the code and results in your markdown notebook
- State your findings from the data and provide the interpretation of results from your analysis at each stage in the project

The code uses the dataset available at:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset

Which also contains explanations of the columns of the dataset. 

This project was done for the class below:

- MADS 500B - Data Science Programming
- University of San Diego
